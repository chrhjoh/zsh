# ZSH Config files

This repository contain config files for zsh.

### Requirements
Both oh-my-zsh and oh-my-posh is required for this setup.

### Setup
After installing the requirements, then clone this repository. 

- To clone on Linux and Mac
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chrhjoh/zsh.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/zsh
```

I prefer to link these files into $HOME for the convenience of also having my zsh configs in one place GitHub.
